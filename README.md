# MazeSolver
 A program I created using the HarvardX AI course theory (Search method with BFS part). I didn't follow the practical example, just the theoretical part, then it may be a little different from the course.

 This version is working , but it does not limit the maze to check positions that it already checked before, so it is probably running more times than it normally would need. As I am fucking lazy, and it is just a for fun project I will not probably include that feature. It's possible to change the maze as you wish, but it won't work if the number of columns is different in any row and possibly won't end if there's no beginnin, ending or no solution.
